# Week 3: Data Processing in Python

This week, our goal is to understand how to clean up a dataset before analyzing it. We will go over how to work with different types of data, such as strings and dates.

## Learning Objectives

* Identify data potentially leading to pitfalls in analysis
* Filter and “clean” datasets by removing outliers etc.
* Deal with data in various formats (e.g. timestamps, strings)
